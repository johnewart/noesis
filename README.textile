h2. Noesis

Noesis is a course-management system that I'm actively developing for managing courses. 


h2. Current Status

I am in the process of migrating the code from *old* Rails 1.1.x standards to 2.3.x standards. I started this *years* ago and am just now getting back to finishing a lot of features I've learned I need over the years. 

h2. Plans

Things not yet implemented, but being cooked up:

* Support for S5 or LaTeX beamer slideshow creation in the system (with exporting to PDF)
* Advanced grade import / export features (Moodle, Sakai, WebCT, etc) 
* Better gradebook features
* Payment system (for offering private courses)
* ... anything else that comes to mind as I work on it.
